  <h1>Dynamic Chess Rules</h1>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>The objective of Dynamic Chess is the same as standard chess: to checkmate your opponent's king.</p>
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>The game follows the standard rules of chess, with the following exceptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Piece Movement</h3>
      <p>Pieces can be moved using the mouse or the keyboard.</p>
      <h4>Mouse</h4>
      <p>Click on a piece to select it, then click on a valid cell to move it.</p>
      <h4>Keyboard</h4>
      <p>Press a key to select a piece type (p, r, n, b, q, k). If multiple pieces of the same type can be moved, pressing the same key again will cycle through the available pieces.</p>
      <p>Use the numpad (1-9) to move the selected piece. The direction is based on the numpad layout.</p>
      <p>For pawns, rooks, bishops, and queens, the distance of the move is determined by how long you press the key.</p>
      <p>For knights, a short press on a numpad key will move the knight to the first possible cell in that direction, and a long press will move it to the second possible cell.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Cooldowns</h3>
      <p>Each piece has a cooldown period after it moves, during which it cannot be moved again. The cooldown is represented by a grey overlay on the piece's square, which fades as the cooldown expires.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pawns: 2 seconds</li>
        <li>Knights: 6 seconds</li>
        <li>Bishops: 6 seconds</li>
        <li>Rooks: 9 seconds</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
